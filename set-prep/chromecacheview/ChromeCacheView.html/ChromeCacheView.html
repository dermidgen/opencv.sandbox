<h4 class="utilsubject">Description</h4>
ChromeCacheView is a small utility that reads the cache folder of Google Chrome Web browser,
and displays the list of all files currently stored in the cache.
For each cache file, the following information is displayed: URL, Content type, File size, Last accessed time,
 Expiration time, Server name, Server response, and more.
<br>
You can easily select one or more items from the cache list, and then extract the files to another folder, or 
copy the URLs list to the clipboard.




<p>
<h4 class="utilsubject">The Location Of Chrome Cache Folder</h4>
The cache folder of Google Chrome is located under [User Profile]\Local Settings\Application Data\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cache

<p>
<h4 class="utilsubject">Using ChromeCacheView</h4>

<br>
After you run it, the main window displays the list of files currently stored in the cache of the default Google Chrome user.

copy the URL list to the clipboard (Ctrl+U), copy the entire table of cache files (Ctrl+C), and then paste it to Excel or to OpenOffice spreadsheet.
